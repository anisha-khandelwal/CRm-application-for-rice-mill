1. Introduction

The Rice Mill CRM Application is a tailored solution for managing and optimizing operations in a wholesale rice mill factory. The primary objective of this project is to develop a feature-rich and user-friendly CRM application that enhances customer experiences, improves operational efficiency, and provides detailed analytics for better decision-making.

2. Objectives

- To develop a CRM application specifically designed for the unique needs of a rice mill factory.
- To streamline operations by providing daily reports on rice production, sales, and types of rice.
- To implement Salesforce features such as roll up summary fields, cross-object formula fields, validation rules, and permission sets.
- To create an intuitive interface for easy data interpretation by the owner.

3. Features and Functionality

3.1 Reporting and Dashboards
- The application generates comprehensive reports on daily rice production, sales, total income, and customer preferences.
- Dashboards provide visual insights, making it easy for the owner to understand key metrics and optimize resource allocation.

3.2 Roll up Summary Fields
- Roll up summary fields were used to summarize data from rice details to suppliers.
- Functions used include COUNT, SUM, MIN, and MAX to display total values, such as the amount of rice supplied.

3.3 Cross-Object Formula Fields
- Implemented cross-object formula fields to calculate and display the total amount payable, derived from the number of rice units taken multiplied by the price per kilogram.

3.4 Validation Rules
- Validation rules were enforced to ensure data accuracy. For instance, the IsBlank formula was used to trigger error messages when required fields were left blank.

3.5 Permission Sets
- Roles were created with specific permissions to ensure that the owner has access to all records, while employers can view worker records.
- Organizational Wide Defaults (OWD) were set to restrict access appropriately.
